# AWS 3-Tier Architecture

## Overview

The AWS 3-tier architecture is a widely used design pattern for building scalable and reliable applications. It consists of three layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This layer handles the user interface and user experience. It typically includes web servers or load balancers.
2. **Application Layer**: This layer contains the business logic and processes user requests. It often includes application servers or containerized microservices.
3. **Data Layer**: This layer is responsible for data storage and management. It includes databases, data warehouses, or other storage solutions.

## Code Example

Below is an example of deploying a 3-tier architecture using AWS services:

```yaml
Resources:
  WebServer:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890

  ApplicationServer:
    Type: AWS::ECS::Service
    Properties:
      Cluster: !Ref ECSCluster
      TaskDefinition: !Ref ApplicationTask

  Database:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBInstanceClass: db.t2.micro
      Engine: mysql
      MasterUsername: admin
      MasterUserPassword: password
```

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Each layer can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Security**: Layers can be isolated using security groups and subnets.
- **Flexibility**: Components can be replaced or upgraded without affecting the entire system.

## Conclusion

The AWS 3-tier architecture is a robust and flexible design pattern suitable for a wide range of applications. By leveraging AWS services, you can build scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions.
